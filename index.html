        <h2>Let's Get Physical!</h2>
        <p>
            In this decade, digital media has become the way to store your movies, games, 
            and memories. All it takes is one really bad day to have all those important files
            vanish in a flash, and when you least expect it. It might even sound familiar. 
            We've been there, and we believe you do not have to! <br>
            <br>
            This is where Virtual Playback comes in! We are strong advocates that your digital 
            scrapbook or entertainment collage should have a handy backup on rainy days, whether 
            it be a sudden server failure or the internet is on the fritz. We supply various 
            options for physical media type, and players for those who left their ancient tech 
            in the dust.
